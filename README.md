This is a simple Edge AI prototype that trains a lightweight image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is then converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for deployment on low-power devices such as a Raspberry Pi.

The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 10 common object classes: airplane, car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.
